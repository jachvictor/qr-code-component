**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on using semantic HTML5 to structure the page, ensuring better accessibility and SEO. I also used HSL color codes for a consistent and easily adjustable color palette. Integrating Google Fonts improved the overall typography and visual appeal of the design.

Here’s a snippet of code I’m proud of:

```html
<main class="qr-code-container">
  <section class="wrap-qr-code">
    <img src="../../images/image-qr-code.png" class="qr-code" alt="" />

    <header class="qr-code-header">
      Improve your front-end skills by building projects
    </header>
    <p class="qr-code-qoute">
      Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
      the next level
    </p>
  </section>
  <footer class="attribution">

    >. Coded by <a href="#">jachvictor</a>.
  </footer>
</main>
```

```css
.qr-code-header {
  padding: 0 1rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: x-large;
  text-align: center;
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions.

- Continue improving my mobile-first design skills.

- Experiment with CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - Helped me understand the importance of semantic tags.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://web.dev) - his guide was essential for laying out the components.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Provided easy integration of custom fonts.
